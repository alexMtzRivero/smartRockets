# Game maker Smart rockets
Small program developed in game maker to understand the operation of genetic Algorithms
## Description
The project is the result of [series of videos of genetic algorithms created by Daniel shiftman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz7mv2vD6g), I chose the game  maker engine to ensure understanding of the concept and not only copy the code shown  in the tutorial
The goal of the genetic algorithm is to make the "worms" reach the red spot by avoiding the walls. Simple but sufficient enough to understand the behavior of the algorithm
